{"name":"Cpu-simulator","tagline":"CPU - Memory simulation using Java","body":"###OVERVIEW: \r\nThe project will simulate a simple computer system consisting of a CPU and Memory. The CPU and Memory will be simulated by separate processes that communicate. The implementation is done in Java and can be executed on the UNIX platform.\r\n\r\n\r\n###PURPOSE:\r\nThe purpose of this project is to learn how multiple processes can communicate and cooperate with each other. Also, it is meant to help us learn the different concepts of an operating system such as Processor interaction with main memory, I/O processing, memory protection, system and procedure calls, role of registers and stack processing.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
